defmodule Integrator.NonLinearEqnRootRefactor do
  @moduledoc """
  Finds the roots (i.e., zeros) of a non-linear equation.
  Based on [`fzero.m`](https://github.com/gnu-octave/octave/blob/default/scripts/optimization/fzero.m)
  from Octave.

  This is essentially the ACM algorithm 748: Enclosing Zeros of Continuous Functions
  due to Alefeld, Potra and Shi, ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 21,
  No. 3, September 1995. Although the workflow is the same, the structure of
  the algorithm has been transformed non-trivially; also, the algorithm has also been
  slightly modified.
