# Integrator

Numerical integrator written in Elixir for non-stiff differential equations.  `Integrator` 
an adaptation of the [Octave](https://octave.sourceforge.io/octave/function/ode45.html) and 
[Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html) `ode45` integrator. 
This library heavily leverages [Elixir Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx).
